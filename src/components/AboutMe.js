        <p>
          Itâ€™s great to learn about your background and your passion for both
          <span> web development </span> and <strong>art</strong>! Youâ€™ve got a
          solid approach to building websites with a focus on
          <span> responsiveness </span>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and
          <strong>aesthetics</strong>. The combination of
          <span> front-end </span> and <strong>back-end</strong> skills is a
          great way to stay versatile in the tech world.
        </p>

        <p>
          It sounds like youâ€™re juggling multiple interests, which is awesome!
          Creativity in art often translates really well into
          <span> web design </span>, especially when it comes to visual
          aesthetics and <span> user experience </span>. Plus, the skills you're
          honing in <span> React </span> and backend technologies will
          definitely allow you to create more dynamic and robust web
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also noticed you're involved in <span> Abhishek College </span>
          and have some connection to <span> MRSPTU in Bathinda </span>. Is that
          where you're studying or working right now? How's the transition from
          front-end to back-end development going for you?
        </p>

        <p>
          Feel free to

            className="resume"
            href=""
            target="_blank"

          </a>
